defmodule CreditApp.Notifications do
  @moduledoc """
  Outbound notifications' boundary.

  Provides a small, testable API for composing and delivering user-facing messages.
  Currently, implements email delivery via `CreditApp.Mailer` (Swoosh adapter), with
  support for file attachments. Callers pass plain data and receive `{:ok, term} | {:error, term}`
  without caring about the transport details.

  Responsibilities:
    * Build and send transactional emails
    * Attach files when needed
    * Keep a stable public API while allowing transport/config changes per environment

  Extensibility:
    * Add functions per notification (e.g., `send_welcome/1`, `send_invoice/2`)
    * Swap or configure adapters in `CreditApp.Mailer` without changing callers
    * Optional: move delivery to a background job (e.g., Oban) while keeping the same API

  ## Examples

      {:ok, _}
